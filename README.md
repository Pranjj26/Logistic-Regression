# Logistic Regression Project README

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the application of logistic regression, a widely used machine learning algorithm, using Python and popular data science libraries. Logistic regression is a classification algorithm that is used to predict a binary outcome (1 / 0, Yes / No, True / False) given a set of independent variables. In this project, we use a dataset from advertising to predict whether a user clicked on an advertisement based on various features such as age, daily time spent on a website, income, daily internet usage, and gender.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code in this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
- Required Python libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Project Structure

- `Logistic_Regression_Project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and explanations for the logistic regression analysis.
- `advertising.csv`: CSV file containing the dataset used for analysis.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this project repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Logistic_Regression_Project.ipynb`) using your preferred Python IDE or Jupyter Notebook itself.
3. Ensure you have the dataset file named `advertising.csv` in the same directory as the notebook.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run each cell step by step to follow the logistic regression analysis process.
2. The notebook contains detailed comments and explanations for each code cell to help you understand the workflow.

## Exploring the Data

We start by exploring the dataset to gain insights into its structure and contents:

- Loading the dataset using Pandas.
- Displaying basic statistics and information about the data.
- Plotting graphs to visualize the relationships between variables.

## Logistic Regression Model

The main part of the project involves building and training a logistic regression model to predict whether a user clicked on an advertisement:

- Preparing the data by selecting relevant features (`X`) and the target variable (`y`).
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from scikit-learn.
- Creating a logistic regression model using `LogisticRegression` from scikit-learn.
- Fitting the model to the training data.
- Making predictions using the test data.

## Model Evaluation

We evaluate the performance of the logistic regression model using key metrics:

- Generating a classification report to display precision, recall, F1-score, and support.
- Creating a confusion matrix to visualize true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
